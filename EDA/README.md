> With several forecasts suggesting that the eurozone, the United Kingdom and possibly the United States will enter recessionary territory this year, one of the safest choices for investors is consumer staples—that is, everyday necessities that are important for consumers at all times, such as food and beverages, household goods, hygiene products.
> The sector represents one of the most resilient investment choices given that demand for staples is assured irrespective of the economic environment. Indeed, the defensive nature of consumer staples allowed the sector to outperform the broader market last year, with the S&P 500 Consumer Staples (Sector) losing just 3.5 percent compared with the 18-percent loss suffered by the broader benchmark index.

“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition.
